## Getting Started 

If you're here I'm going to assume you've already gone through the onshape tutorial for how to build a basic brick. If you haven't you can find it [here](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/d2d156bfb1db472973063473/w/2ec44ccdcd6dacf683eb0c6f/e/449d413b724c54cc4db32973)

## Updates to the Original

I do have a few things to add to that original assignment once you're done, so make a new document and rebuild that basic lego brick. 

Change the Configuration to a 1x4 and begin a sketch on inside of your lego. At one end of your brick draw a circle tangent to all three sides.
