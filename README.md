## Getting Started 

If you're here I'm going to assume you've already gone through the onshape tutorial for how to build a basic brick. If you haven't you can find it [here](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/d2d156bfb1db472973063473/w/2ec44ccdcd6dacf683eb0c6f/e/449d413b724c54cc4db32973)

## Updates to the Original

I do have a few things to add to that original assignment once you're done, so make a new document and rebuild that basic lego brick. 

Change the Configuration to a 1x4 and begin a sketch on inside of your lego. At one end of your brick draw a circle tangent to all three sides. Then a second circle 8mm away. Between these two Draw a small circle tangent to both.

Extrude the small circle up to the face of the bottom of the brick and then pattern the whole sketch with distance of 8mm and the instances #Columns - 1. 
Open up your configurations table and suppress the new feature for all configurations where rows are greater than 1 and the 1x1. 

Congradulations you just made the Cylinders that provide friction on 1 by X bricks!
