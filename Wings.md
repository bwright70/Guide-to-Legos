# Wings 

If you want to follow along in the parts studio, here is a link to my [original document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/18c55e9aeb64057e8e0fbb6a/w/5c06b8e3c4dcf6e948152fa4/e/18df3578f02c775cfcadaef9?configuration=List_8xTqWDMkkCG2Mw%3D_2x2%3BList_ArQ6GsCPNSkQoQ%3DDefault%3BList_Izy0ldJ6UfParG%3DDefault%3BList_tmPjPdZ9wrB2lD%3DDefault&renderMode=0&uiState=6290d24be366b652b2773d0f). Navigate to the Square Bricks folder and find the Part Studio called Wings. It's towards the back.
