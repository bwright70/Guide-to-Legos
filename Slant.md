# Slant

If you want to follow along in the parts studio, here is a link to my [original document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/18c55e9aeb64057e8e0fbb6a/w/5c06b8e3c4dcf6e948152fa4/e/18df3578f02c775cfcadaef9?configuration=List_8xTqWDMkkCG2Mw%3D_2x2%3BList_ArQ6GsCPNSkQoQ%3DDefault%3BList_Izy0ldJ6UfParG%3DDefault%3BList_tmPjPdZ9wrB2lD%3DDefault&renderMode=0&uiState=6290d24be366b652b2773d0f). Navigate to the Square Bricks folder and find the Part Studio called Slant. 

### Lets Begin

To start make a copy of your original parts studio with the bricks. You can make this in your original parts studio as well, but the more you do this, the more convoluted your part studio is and the assemblies get laggier. 

Making slants is actually very simple. I would recomend designing this on the 2x3 or 1x3 brick. If you are following along in the parts studio ignore Slant Corners. I had those working at one point, but they're broken and I don't feel like fixing them. You can go through and see what I did, but I don't intend to make them work again. 

First make a sketch on the Width side of your brick.
